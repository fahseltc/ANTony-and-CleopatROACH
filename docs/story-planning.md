5 Act structure but RTS style

## Level 1 "Lovers of the Nile"

Setting: Alexandria
Playable Faction: Roaches + Antony (hero)
Objectives:
Build up a luxurious Egyptian capital (base-building and resource gathering).
Train a small elite force to repel Roman scouts.
Fend off waves of Roman envoys trying to “bring Antony home.”
Optional: Throw a feast to boost morale and unlock unique units.

Cinematic/Dialogue:
Opens with Cleopatra lounging while Antony ignores war reports.
Dialogue shows tension: envoys urge Antony to return to Rome.
Cleopatra: "If you must needs depart, go in thy glory. But what is Rome to love?""
Ends with Antony reluctantly saying: "Then must I answer Rome’s cold..."

## Level 2: "The Triumvirs"

Setting: Rome
Playable Faction: Rome (Antony, Octavius Caesar, Lepidus)
Objectives:

    Manage diplomacy: form an uneasy alliance with Octavius Caesar.

    Defend against Pompey’s growing navy.

    Marry Octavia (cutscene choice) to gain loyalty points and reinforcements.

    Maintain public approval (a morale-style meter).

Cinematic/Dialogue:

    At the Senate steps, Caesar: “We must bind our brotherhood in blood.”

    Antony: “My sword may sign what my heart protests.”

    Scene ends with Octavia’s wedding, as Cleopatra's silhouette watches from afar (via spy unit?).

    Level 3: “The Queen’s Gambit”

Setting: Eastern Mediterranean & Sea of Actium
Playable Faction: Dual-split – Egypt (Cleopatra), then switch to Rome (Antony) mid-mission
Objectives:

    Use Cleopatra’s navy to draw out Caesar’s fleet.

    Mid-battle, retreat with Cleopatra’s ships (scripted).

    Antony must respond: either follow (fail condition) or stay and fight (alternate dialogue path).

    No matter what, the outcome is defeat—sets up story drama.

Cinematic/Dialogue:

    Antony watches Cleopatra flee: “Like a doting mallard, I chase the swan…”

    Caesar: “He trades Rome’s steel for silken lies.”


    Level 4: “Ashes of Empire”

Setting: Egypt (desert and palace ruins)
Playable Faction: Antony (fractured forces)
Objectives:

    Scramble to defend Alexandria with limited troops.

    Try to recruit former allies (based on earlier player choices).

    Cleopatra fakes her death to test Antony’s love—if you find the scroll, avoid tragedy (bonus).

    Antony stabs himself (scripted scene).

Cinematic/Dialogue:

    Antony dying: “Not Caesar’s pride, nor fate’s cold hand—thy love undid me.”

    Cleopatra mourns: “Noblest of men, my Egypt lies with thee.”

Level 5: “The Immortal Serpent”

Setting: Cleopatra’s Mausoleum
Playable Faction: Cleopatra (final stand)
Objectives:

    Defend your palace against Caesar’s elite units for a set time.

    Build the Mausoleum as a wonder (RTS-style) to unlock escape.

    In final minutes, choose: flee (bad ending), surrender (humiliation), or build the asp chamber (true ending).

Cinematic/Dialogue:

    Cleopatra: “Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have immortal longings in me.”

    Snake-bite cutscene ends with Caesar arriving too late.

    Caesar: “She shall be buried by her Antony. A pair so famed, the world shall sigh.”
