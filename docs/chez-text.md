Antony, the chiefest bug in our estate,
Has fled afar, to where his heart calls home
To Cleopatroach, wherein twines our fates,
'twixt bright Egypt and our most holy Rome.
Yet we must know: war does not wait for love,
Nor stills the bloody business of our cause
Mantis Pompey hath returned gracious dove,
By baring all: both mandible and claw.
Hear us: if Mantis sing the rebel's song
Then Antony will silence him 'ere long.

Enemy Leader 1: Mantis Pompey (pun of Sextus Pompey, rebel against Antony)
Enemy Leader 2: Enobarkbug (pun of Enobarbus, Antony's traitor friend)
Enemy Leader 3: Emperor Bugustus (pun on Emperor Augustus)
