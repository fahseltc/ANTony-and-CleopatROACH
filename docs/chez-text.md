Antony, the chiefest bug in our estate,
Has fled afar, to where his heart calls home
To Cleopatroach, wherein twines our fates,
'twixt bright Egypt and our most holy Rome.
Yet we must know: war does not wait for love,
Nor stills the bloody business of our cause
Mantis Pompey hath returned gracious dove,
By baring all: both mandible and claw.
Hear us: if Mantis sing the rebel's song
Then Antony will silence him 'ere long.

Enemy Leader 1: Mantis Pompey (pun of Sextus Pompey, rebel against Antony)
Enemy Leader 2: Enobarkbug (pun of Enobarbus, Antony's traitor friend)
Enemy Leader 3: Emperor Bugustus (pun on Emperor Augustus)

NARRATOR 1
In the land of Nilopolis, where the sand meets sugar and the air hums with wingèd gossip, two empires crawl toward destiny. One: the mighty Ant-tonian Legion, proud builders and brave foragers. The other: Queen Cleopatroach’s royal roachdom, ancient, secretive, and ever-scheming.
Long hath love fluttered betwixt Antony, soldier of soil, and Cleopatroach, goddess of grime. But lo! A chasm divides them, wide as a footprint and deep as a drain. Wood must be gathered. A bridge must be built. And their love… must scuttle onward.
Arise, player! Command thy swarm! The Ant Game begins!

    Narrator (Post-Level 1 Completion)

“And so, with twig and grit and tiny limbs unnumbered, the bridge was wrought! Across the void did Antony march, bold as a wasp in a wineglass, toward his queen!”

“Their antennae touched in triumph, and though their path remaineth plagued with pest and peril, this moment—this mandible-kiss of destiny—shall be sung in the tunnels of time.”

“But peace is never long in the insect world. New foes stir. New challenges arise. Onward… to Level the Second!”
