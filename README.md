# Ebitengine Game Jam

This repo is for the [Ebitengine Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ebitengine-game-jam-2025) held from 6/15/2025 to 6/29/2025.
The game can be played at: https://charlesfahselt.com/ebitengine-gamejam/ OR https://digdugdiggy.itch.io/antony-and-cleopatroach

The game jam theme:

```
The theme for the event is: UNION ∪🍤 今回のテーマはユニオン (結合、和集合、同盟、etc.) です!

It can mean:
The act of uniting or the state of being united
Union between 2 people, for example marriage or civil union
Union among many people, for example a trade union or a union of countries (e.g. EU)
In mathematics, when you combine two or more sets
And many more related meanings 😉 you can even make an acronym from U.N.I.O.N.
```

## About The Game

![Game Screenshot](/dev-screenshots/itch.io/cover.png)
**Ant**ony and Cleopat**roach** is an RTS game inspired by Starcraft, set in the Shakespearean tragedy Antony and Cleopatra.

The goal of the game is to collect resources and build bridges to bring Antony and Cleopatroach together.

Combat was intended for later levels, but I didn't have enough time due to the game jam 2 week limitation.

This game was created for the Ebitengine 2025 GameJam from June 15th to June 29th. Its coded in Golang.

6/29/2025 - Fixed a minor issue discovered. In the original submission of this game to the jam, the game would crash at the start of level 2 due to a missing asset. I re-added this asset to the game, and level 2 and onward will now work. This stuff was all created during the jam and just fixes a minor issue, but I put this message here for posterity.

# Future Plans

I plan to add some more things to this game, including but not limited to some or many of the following

- Ant combat
- An antagonist in the story (Enubarkbug or Emporer Bugustus)
- Unit grouping UI and hotkeys
- Better pathfinding like A\*
- Patrol action
- On-hover tooltips over buttons
